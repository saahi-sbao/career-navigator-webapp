// This file has been modified because Next.js Server Actions are not compatible
// with the static export configuration (`output: 'export'`) enabled in next.config.js.
// The 'use server' directive and all action functions have been removed to allow the build to succeed.
// To re-enable Server Actions, you must remove `output: 'export'` from next.config.js
// and restore the contents of this file from your version history.
